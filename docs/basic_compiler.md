Basic compiler
==============

For the first time ever, you are provided with a basic compiler that can lex, parse and generate code for only the following program:
```
int f()
{
    return 5;
}
```

Having a somewhat functioning compiler should allow you to get started with development of the interesting parts of this coursework while avoiding the common early pitfalls that students have faced in previous years. It should also allow you to better understand the underlying C90 grammar and have an easier time adding new features.

The provided basic compiler is able to traverse the following AST related to the above program. In order to expand its capabilities, you should develop the parser and the corresponding code generation at the same time - do not try to fully implement one before the other.

The lexer and parser are loosely based on the "official" grammar covered [here](https://www.lysator.liu.se/c/ANSI-C-grammar-l.html) and [here](https://www.lysator.liu.se/c/ANSI-C-grammar-y.html) respectively. While they should suffice for a significant portions of features, you might need to improve them to implement the more advanced ones. If you find the grammar too complicated to understand, it is also perfectly fine to create your own simple grammar and build upon it as you add more features.

Two versions of the grammar have been provided:

- [parser.y](../src/parser.y) contains a stripped down version of the grammar which contains only the elements from the full grammar that are necessary to parse the above program. **This is the grammar used when you run ./test.sh**.
- [parser_full.y.example](../src/parser_full.y.example) is the same as `parser.y` but also contains the rest of the C90 grammar not used in the above program. Once you understand how the stripped version works, you have two options: you can extend `parser.y` at your own pace and add pieces of the C90 grammar to it as you implement them; alternatively, you may paste the contents of `parser_full.y.example` into `parser.y` allowing you to parse everything but this may make the file much harder to navigate.

Note that you don't have to use any of the provided grammar examples (or even flex and bison) if you are comfortable with doing something else. However, be warned that TAs will likely only be able to provided limited support for such alternatives.

You can follow the patterns introduced for the code generation part of the basic compiler, but you might find adjusting them to your needs be better in the long run. You are recommended to follow the coding style that best suits you while hopefully picking strong design skills throughout the development of your compiler.
